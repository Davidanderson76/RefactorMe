Code Refactor
This code was provided to me to refactor and clean up to the best of my abilities without altering the functionality or aesthetic of the original site.
I started off by making the code easier to read by spacing out some elements and indenting to make it take up less page, increasing readability.
Next I condensed the id's given to the nav bar elements into a single class of "content-section" so in the css file it would only require one selector to modify the group of them.
Then I added a section element within the body so all similar style changes could be condensed in the css file.
